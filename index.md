<p> Let me tell you what this blog is NOT about. It's not about giving you fast and short answers. It's not about dumbing down topics. Go somewhere else for that. Instead, this blog is a forum for long format answers to questions and scenarios that arise in the workplace. Specifically, these may fall in the realm of the following.</p><br>
<ul> <li>Learning and Development</li><li>Customer Education</li><li>People Managment</li><li>Technology Adoption</li><li>and much more</li></ul><br>
<p>Looking forward to having the long and unhurried conversations with all of you fine people.</p>
